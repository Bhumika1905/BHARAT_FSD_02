Money Tracking Web Application was developed using HTML,CSS,JavaScript,MongoDB as a part of my Internship at Bharat Intern as a Full Stack Development Intern.HTML was used to structure the elements of the structure.This App helps to manage the income and expenses of a personal.
This web application will help you keep track of your expenses and gain better control over your spending.
We will start by creating the basic HTML file with a title, heading, form, and expense list container. Then, we will apply basic CSS styles for a visually appealing look. Next, we will capture form input, validate it, create an expense object, and store it in an array. We will then dynamically loop through the expense array and create HTML elements to display expenses. Finally, we will implement a delete functionality to remove expenses from the array and update the rendered list.
